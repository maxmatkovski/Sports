### App idea UnderstandingVegas --> 
- Create model building odds before they come out. Explains to user how the odds are created and gives an explanation of things to consider.
- Allows user to make an “optimal” bet.
- Has user take a survey to predict what bet they should make even if they believe lakers win they can say what they value about the lakers ie passing and then make the economic bet not the emotional one 
- Host model, machine learning model build, infrastructure, deployment, stats knowdlege, think of this as creating multifaceted project (putting everything together) and software skills and data ML skills and create mvp and have ability to test iterate
- 

( full model, have scraper that scrapes live to update the model, host model, create front end).
